/*Tax Calculator: Create a program that calculates the income tax for a person based on their income. Consider different tax slabs and apply the appropriate tax rate using if-else statements.

	If the salary is below 10k then no tax.
	if between 10k-20k then 10% tax
	if between 20k-30k then 15% tax
	and if the basic is above 30k then flat 25% tax is applicable.*/
